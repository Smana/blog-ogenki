I’m currently on my flight back from the Kubecon EU 2022 and plenty of ideas are currently flooding my brain. Actually this has been a long time I’m considering starting my own blog post. My main target here is to play and learn about new technologies and share my experimentations and findings.

While I’m writing this I don’t know what will be the topics in a few months but you’ll find here my next target:

## Who am I?

I'm a senior Site Reliability Engineer with a particular interest in Linux containers and cloud technologies.
I worked in different companies (small startups and large scale) and I've been working in different areas in order to improve the reliability, availability of the platform as well as the developer experience.
I helped several companies in their transition to the Cloud. I was leading SRE/DevOps teams (diverse profiles with developers and SREs) and I really enjoy seeing them engaged in the same direction.

As side activities, I am an organizer of the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) meetup in Paris and I have the role of CNCF Ambassador in France.

Hobbies: Reading SF books, Kick Boxing, Surfing/Skating/Inline Roller
