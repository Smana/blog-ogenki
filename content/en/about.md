## Who am I?

I'm a senior Site Reliability Engineer with a particular interest in Linux containers and cloud technologies.
I worked in different companies (small startups and large scale) and I've been working in different areas in order to improve the reliability, availability of the platform as well as the developer experience.
I helped several companies in their transition to the Cloud. I was leading SRE/DevOps teams (diverse profiles with developers and SREs) and I really enjoy seeing them engaged in the same direction.

As side activities, I am an organizer of the Cloud Native Computing meetup in Paris and the [Kubernetes Community Days France](https://www.kcdfrance.fr/).

Hobbies: Reading SF books, Kick Boxing, Surfing/Skating/Inline Roller
